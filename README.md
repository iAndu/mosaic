# Mosaic generator

## Description
This is a Python application that fetches a given image and creates a mosaic based on a collection of images that should in the end resemble the original picture. It works with both RGB and grayscale images.

## How to use
Step 1: Set the appropiate options at the beginning of the program, specifying things such as the path to the image, the path to the collection, number of horizontal patches to be used (so an appropiate resizing could be done), the method to arrange the patches, the method used to select the replacement for a patch and some other options.

Step 2: Run the script and enjoy your mosaic.

## Examples
